Tasks and context (1–2 paragraphs)
Circuit breaker events in our markets are rare but high-impact, and understanding them requires continuous analysis of high-frequency market data rather than reactive, one-off investigations. Trading, market risk, surveillance, and business teams need timely insight into evolving market conditions—such as abnormal price moves, liquidity deterioration, and order-flow stress—that may precede a circuit breaker, as well as clear, data-driven explanations of what occurred once a halt or pause has taken place. Historically, this insight is derived through manual analysis across order book updates, transactions, and reference data, resulting in slow turnaround, fragmented narratives, and limited accessibility beyond technical teams.
This use case focuses on continuous monitoring and insight generation, not direct intervention in trading or matching engines. The system analyzes market data in near-real time to surface early warning signals of impending circuit breaker conditions, supports standardized post-event analysis, and enables structured what-if scenario analysis to evaluate alternative trigger definitions or dynamically calibrated thresholds for individual products. By translating complex microstructure behavior into explainable metrics, visual summaries, and natural-language answers, the solution empowers business and market integrity teams to communicate clearly with market participants—answering questions on observed events, product behavior, and potential improvements to circuit breaker logic—while maintaining a strict separation from live trading operations.

Solution implemented (1–2 paragraphs)
The solution has two integrated components. First, a Python + SQL analytics pipeline continuously processes high-frequency order book data and transaction records to detect and label circuit breaker events using standardized, parameterized logic. It identifies event start and end points, reference prices, and recovery periods, and computes diagnostic features such as pre- and post-event price movement, traded volume, spread, depth, order-flow imbalance, and time-to-recovery. The same pipeline also supports counterfactual “what-if” analysis by allowing trigger parameters (e.g., price bands, settlement prices, volume bands, volatility-scaled thresholds, lookback windows, and persistence rules) to be varied and replayed on historical data, generating synthetic event timelines and comparable market-quality metrics across scenarios. This creates a repeatable, auditable foundation for both observed and hypothetical circuit breaker behavior.
Second, a LangGraph-based AI agent wraps the detection, analytics, and scenario-testing methods as callable tools and exposes them through a conversational interface. Users can ask natural-language questions such as “Show all ES circuit breaker events last month,” “What liquidity signals preceded the halt?”, or “Under a volatility-scaled trigger, how would event frequency and recovery differ for this product?” The agent plans and executes the appropriate queries, retrieves validated tables and aggregations, and returns clear summaries, charts, and narrative explanations grounded in computed metrics. By focusing on explainability and traceability, the agent enables both technical and business teams to explore historical events, assess alternative circuit breaker designs, and communicate data-driven insights to market participants without any interaction with live trading systems.


Impact / primary value driver (AI-first, blended)
The agent applies AI to transform circuit breaker analysis from a slow, manual, expert-driven process into a continuous, explainable insight system, reducing time-to-analysis from hours to minutes. By standardizing event detection, diagnostics, and scenario evaluation across products, it improves consistency, auditability, and analytical coverage for risk, surveillance, and business teams. AI-driven orchestration and natural-language access allow non-technical users to explore complex order book behavior, assess what-if trigger designs, and rapidly generate clear, data-backed narratives. Continuous monitoring surfaces early warning signals of stressed market conditions, while post-event analytics and scenario testing support evidence-based discussions on market behavior and potential enhancements to protection logic. Overall, the solution strengthens market integrity insights and communication without introducing any control path into live trading systems.
